# GN QuickCheck - UX Design & Prototyping

*GN QuickCheck* is a digital platform designed to streamline access to Grama Niladhari (GN) services in Sri Lanka. This group project aims to reduce stress, uncertainty, and inefficiency for citizens seeking essential documents like NICs, certificates, verifications, and permits.  

---

## Problem Statement

Accessing GN services has become stressful, time-consuming, and inefficient due to several challenges:

- *Information Uncertainty*: Citizens often do not know the exact documents required for different services, leading to repeated visits and confusion.  
- *Availability Uncertainty*: People are unaware of GN availability, office hours, or whether the officer is out on field duties, resulting in wasted time.  
- *Process Anxiety & Emotional Stress*: Unclear procedures, misinformation, and long waiting times cause frustration, mental pressure, and lack of clarity.  
- *No Unified Digital Platform*: There is no centralized online system to check GN schedules, required documents, sample forms, or service instructions in an accessible way.  

The absence of real-time information and guidance directly affects citizens’ digital well-being and reduces efficiency in public administrative services.

## Solution

GN QuickCheck provides a *single, user-friendly digital platform* where citizens can:  

- Check GN officer availability in real-time.  
- View required documents for different services.  
- Access sample forms and instructions.  
- Prepare before visiting GN offices, minimizing stress and unnecessary trips.
